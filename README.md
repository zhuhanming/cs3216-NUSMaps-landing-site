# [NUSMaps - The App to Help You Navigate NUS](https://zhuhanming.github.io/cs3216-NUSMaps-landing-site/)

NUSMaps is a UI/UX interactive prototype developed in 3 weeks for CS3216 Assignment 1 - Product Design.

## What is NUSMaps?

Students of the National University of Singapore (NUS) often face difficulties in finding their way to their lesson venues, especially due to the hard-to-remember venue codes and the mountainous terrain of NUS.  
  
As such, NUSMaps was conceptualised to help alleviate this problem, by providing users with clear location-to-location navigation, accurate route recommendations and predictions, and in-building navigation.
